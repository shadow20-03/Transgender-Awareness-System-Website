            Transgender awareness is the knowledge and acceptance of transgender people's experiences, needs, and rights. Transgender persons have a gender identification that differs from the sex given to them at birth.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: large;padding-left:1.5cm;padding-right:1.5cm">
            Transgender problems must be addressed since transgender people suffer considerable hurdles and discrimination in many parts of their lives, including access to healthcare, work, education, and housing. Discrimination can result in mental illness, social isolation, and even physical violence.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: large;padding-left:1.5cm;padding-right:1.5cm;">
            Understanding and respecting the gender identity and expression of all persons, regardless of whether they correspond to traditional gender norms, is fundamental to transgender awareness. It also requires understanding the vocabulary and terminology used to describe transgender people and their lives.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: large;padding-left:1.5cm;padding-right:1.5cm;">
            Also, it is critical to campaign for laws and practises that support transgender people's rights and well-being. Supporting law that protect transgender persons from discrimination and harassment, giving access to gender-affirming healthcare, and establishing inclusive settings in schools and workplaces are all examples of how this may be done.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: large;padding-left:1.5cm;padding-right:1.5cm;padding-bottom:1.5cm">
            Overall, transgender awareness aims to create a society in which all people may live genuinely and without fear of discrimination or violence because of their gender identification.

            People whose gender is not male or female use many different terms to describe themselves, with nonbinary
            being one of the most common (sometimes spelled with a hyphen, as “non-binary”). Other terms include
            genderqueer, agender, bigender, genderfluid, and more. None of these terms mean exactly the same thing - but
            all speak to an experience of gender that is not simply male or female. If you're not sure what a word
            means, you can usually just ask politely.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: large;padding-left:1.5cm;padding-right:1.5cm">
            It is nothing new to be nonbinary. Non-binary people are not confused about who they are or are adopting a
            new trend; nonbinary identities have been accepted by nations and societies all over the world for
            millennia.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: large;padding-left:1.5cm;padding-right:1.5cm">
            Nonbinary people can undertake medical operations to have their body more in line with their gender
            identity, but not all of them do. Although not all nonbinary persons require medical care to live happy
            lives, for many it is essential and even life-saving.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: large;padding-left:1.5cm;padding-right:1.5cm;padding-bottom:1.5cm">
            Nonbinary transgender people are uncommon. While some transgender individuals have a non-binary gender
            identification, the majority of transgender persons have a gender identity that is either male or female,
            and they need to be treated in the same manner as any other man or woman.
