            More than one in four transgender people have lost their jobs as a result of prejudice, and more than
            three-fourths have dealt with employment discrimination in some capacity. Employer discrimination, invasions
            of privacy, harassment, and even physical and sexual assault on the job are all frequent incidents that
            transgender individuals of colour suffer at significantly higher rates. People frequently mention leaving
            their jobs to avoid discrimination or the possibility of it. One in eight people turn to the underground
            economies—such as prostitution and drug work—in order to live due to the extreme unemployment and poverty.

            According to the transgender persons (Protection of Rights) Bill 2016, it is unlawful to discriminate
            against a transgender person, including by treating them unfairly or by refusing to provide services in the
            areas of employment, education, healthcare, and access to public facilities and goods, among other things.

            In addition, the Indian Supreme Court struck down Section 377 of the Indian Criminal Code in 2018, declaring
            it unconstitutional with regard to consenting homosexual relations between adults, decriminalising
            homosexuality.

            Like everyone else, transgender persons require both acute care when they are ill or injured as well as preventive care to be healthy. For some people, gender dysphoria may also require medical attention. Health treatment for transgender people is subject to widespread stigma and misunderstanding. Transition-related care could be portrayed as "cosmetic" or a personal preference by others who are unaware of the health requirements of transgender people. The truth is that medical professionals overwhelmingly agree that transition-related care is effective for many transgender people and is therefore required by law.

        <p style="font-size: large;padding-left:1.5cm;padding-right:1.5cm;">
            For transgender people, the health benefit package under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana will provide health insurance in the form of Ayushman Bharat TG Plus, which includes gender reassignment surgery. Each transgender person participating in the programme will receive a yearly insurance benefit of Rs. 5 lakh.

        <p style="font-size: large;padding-left:1.5cm;padding-right:1.5cm;padding-bottom:1.5cm;">
            The government must take action to offer transgender people with health facilities, such as private HIV surveillance centres and sex reassignment surgery. The government must revise medical education to address transgender people's health challenges and offer them complete health insurance programmes.

            For many transgender people, discrimination is a daily occurrence that can have an impact in almost every aspect of life. According to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 20% of trans people were denied housing or evicted from their homes, 50% experienced workplace harassment, and 78% of trans students reported being harassed or physically assaulted. And when the trans person is a person of colour and additionally encounters aggravating racism, the transphobia that motivates the prejudice is intensified. The rate of prejudice against trans people of colour is higher.

        <p style="font-size: large;padding-left:1.5cm;padding-right:1.5cm;">
            In order to prevent discrimination from occurring in the first place, it is crucial to have clear non-discrimination rules that address gender identity and expression. Businesses frequently have anti-discrimination policies and teach staff to abide by them as a result of clear regulations. At this stage, both state and federal sex discrimination laws offer a great deal of protection.

            All transgender people are protected by Section 18 of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act from all types of abuse, including physical, verbal, emotional, sexual, mental, and financial abuse, and violators will face a minimum sentence of six months in jail and a maximum of two years in prison as well as a fine. Regrettably, it does not specify a unique procedure for filing a complaint against any of the abuses outlined above.

            Voting is a key part of our participation in society and having our voices heard in the issues that affect us all, and we have the right to vote regardless of gender identity. Having ID that doesn't match your gender identity or presentation should not affect your right to cast a ballot, in any state. But with increasingly strict voter ID laws, trans people may face barriers—both because of difficulties in obtaining an ID that's accepted, or because they might run into bias or misunderstandings of the law when it comes to their gender.

            Knowing your rights can assist in preventing or resolving issues at the polls while the battle against stringent voter ID and other voter suppression measures rages on. We want everybody to cast a ballot!
